# SageModeler/Building Models topology tagger

This code was extracted from the [building-models](https://github.com/concord-consortium/building-models) repo so that it can be shared with the SageModeler report-item interactive.

Existing version numbers of all dependencies were preserved with the exception of TypeScript which was upgraded from 3.1.3 to 3.9.4 so that .d.ts files could be emitted.
